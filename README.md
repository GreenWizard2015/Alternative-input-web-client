# Alternative-input-web-client

This is a web client for collecting the dataset necessary to train the neural network in the [Alternative Input](https://github.com/GreenWizard2015/Alternative-input/) project.
I want to express gratitude to [DarkHole1](https://github.com/DarkHole1), who took on this part of the main project.
